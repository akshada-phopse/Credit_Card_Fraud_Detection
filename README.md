# Credit Fraud Detection

This project is a **Credit Fraud Detection System** built using a **Random Forest Classifier** and a **Streamlit** interface. The model detects fraudulent transactions from a dataset, performs data exploration, and evaluates the model's performance using various metrics.

## Project Overview

This app allows users to:
- Explore a dataset of credit card transactions
- View statistics and correlations of the dataset
- Train a Random Forest model to classify transactions as either fraudulent or valid
- Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
- Visualize the confusion matrix to observe the classification results

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Explore and visualize the dataset, including details on fraud and valid transactions.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Display a heatmap of the correlation between various features in the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest model on the dataset to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: After training the model, evaluate its performance using various metrics and visualize the confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language used for data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the web application.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Machine learning algorithm used for classification.
